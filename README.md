## Howdy 🤠

## My name is Emily!

Currently, I am an undergraduate computer science and data science student at Old Dominion University!

When I am not working on my assignments for school, I love to play video games and work on cars. 

As I complete coding projects I will add them to my GitHub page to show off my work!
