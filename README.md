## Howdy 🤠

## My name is Emily!

Currently, I am an undergraduate computer science and data science student at Old Dominion University!

When I am not working on my assignments for school, I love to play video games and work on cars. 



## Overview of my Repositories
Currently, my repositories are all my favorite previous programming assignments from classes I have taken that I plan to optimize as I learn more about programming.

### ODU CS432: Web Science - Currently Enrolled: Fall 2025
Provides an overview of the World Wide Web and associated decentralized information structures, focusing mainly on the computing aspects of the Web: how it works, how it is used, and how it can be analyzed. Students will examine a number of topics including: web architecture, web characterization and analysis, web archiving, Web 2.0, social networks, collective intelligence, search engines, web mining, information diffusion on the web, and the Semantic Web. Prerequisites: A grade of C or better in any one of: CS 250, CS 251, CS 253, CS 260, CS 261, CS 263, or DASC 255.

Repositories
