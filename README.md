# My name is Emily!

Currently, I am an undergraduate computer science and data science student at Old Dominion University!

When I am not working on my assignments for school, I love to play video games and work on cars.

# Overview of my Repositories
Currently, my repositories are all my favorite previous programming assignments from classes I have taken that I plan to optimize as I learn more about programming.

## ODU CS432: Web Science - Currently Enrolled: Fall 2025
Provides an overview of the World Wide Web and associated decentralized information structures, focusing mainly on the computing aspects of the Web: how it works, how it is used, and how it can be analyzed. Students will examine a number of topics including: web architecture, web characterization and analysis, web archiving, Web 2.0, social networks, collective intelligence, search engines, web mining, information diffusion on the web, and the Semantic Web. Prerequisites: A grade of C or better in any one of: CS 250, CS 251, CS 253, CS 260, CS 261, CS 263, or DASC 255.

### Repositories
  * html-uri-crawler
  * content-extractor
  * timemap-harvester
  * *more assignments will be assigned later on in this course*

## TCC CSC222: Object-Oriented Programming with Java - 2024
Introduces the concepts and techniques of object-oriented programming to students with a background in procedural programming and problem solving. Uses a high-level computer language to illustrate and implement the topics. Second course in a three-course sequence.

**Note: These programs were completed when I first started programming and have not been optimized or refactored since 2024. I have included them for transparency and as part of my academic portfolio. They will be updated in the future.**
